Gammapy is an open-source Python package for gamma-ray astronomy. It is an
in-development affiliated package of Astropy that builds on the core scientific
Python stack (Numpy, Scipy, Astropy) to provide tools to simulate and analyse
the gamma-ray sky for imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) such as
H.E.S.S., VERITAS, MAGIC and CTA as well as other gamma-ray telescopes (e.g.
HAWC and Fermi-LAT). We will give an overview of Gammapy and highlight new
features for IACT data handling, background modeling, source detection as well
as image and spectral analysis.
